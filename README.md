this will automatically paste & enter commands

i use it for rail game, but maybe it can be useful for something else too

how to use?

just edit the commands.csv to your actual commands

and `python main.py`

then once u focus on the chatbox or whatever, press f1

u can also modify the csv, and then f1 again to re-execute the stuff
